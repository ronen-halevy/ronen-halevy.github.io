YOLO is a fully convolutional network and its eventual output is generated by applying a 1 x 1 kernel on a feature map

Route Layer
In the YOLOv3 model, the Route layer is usefull to bring finer grained features in from earlier in the network. This mean that its main function is to recover output from previous layer in the network and bring them forward, avoiding all the in-between processes. Moreover, it is able to recall more than one layer’s output, by concatenating them. In this case though, all Route layer’s input must have the same width and height. It’s role in a CNN is similar to what has alredy been described for the Shortcut layer.

In the YOLOv3 applications, it’s always used to concatenate outputs by channels: let out1 = (batch, w, h, c1) and out2 = (batch, w, h, c2) be the two inputs of the Route layer, then the final output will be a tensor of shape (bacth, w, h, c1 + c2), as described here. On the other hand, the popular Machine Learning library Caffe, let the user chose, by the Concat Layer, if the concatenation must be performed channels or batch dimension, in a similar way as described above.

Our implementation is similar to Caffe, even though the applications will have more resamblance with YOLO models.

An example on how to instantiate a Route layer and use it is shown in the code below:
