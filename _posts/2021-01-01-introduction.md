# Introduction


Here's is my first post on machine learning and deep learning. It will be followed by posts both on theory and implementation topics. So, this is a kind of an intro.
If so, I should start with a definitoion of 'What Machine Learning is'. Here's the definition:  Machine Learning, (or Iâ€™d prefer to speak of Machine Learning Algorithms), are computer algorithms which improve automatically through reference from data.

I'll explain the meaning of "improve automatically through reference from data", and emphasize the difference between Machine Learning Algorithms and conventional algorithms, using an example problem.

## Example Problem: Classify pictures to one of the 2 classes: "cat" or "not a cat".
So here's the classical problem: We need an algorithm which can classify pictures into 2 classes: "cat" if it shows a cat, or "not a cat" otherwise. Figure 1 would belong to the "cat" class. Figure 2 would not.
So, how shoild be problem be solved?

### Figure 1: This is a cat!

![This is a cat](../assets/images/pictures/definitely-a-cat.jpg)

Let's put Machine Learning aside, and consider a solution for this classification problem, using a conventional, non-machine learning algorithm solution. So, a conventional solution would probably be implemented using dedicated (and complicated) computer vision algorithms, which would try to detect a cat-like object in the picture, by extraction of cat characterizing features within the picture. 

Take a look at that cute cat up here: the algorithm needs to detect charectarizing features such as the ears, eyes, whiskers, etc. Not an easy job at all! It requires complicated parsing and detection algorithms, and be indifferent to so many potential camera perspectives, poses, colors, scales, and just name it... And..let's assume that mission is possible, algorithm can make it, and is able to determine a cat - when he sees a picture of a one. But, what about a picture of 'not a cat',  but with lots of cat-like features - I mean - take a look at the puppy below!

### Figure 2: Not a cat!

![Not a cat](../assets/images/pictures/not-a-cat.jpg)



Indeed complicated, and indeed the performance of conventional computer vision algorithms for such tasks, in terms of false detections and miss detections, were in many cases not satisfactory enough. 


A Machine Learning algorithm, would tackle such a problems in a totally different approach. Rather than using sophisticated computer vision algorithms, the machine learning way to determine whether a picture is of a cat or not, is by first calculate a parametric predictor model (using stochastic maximum likelihood estimation methods), based on the on an input data set called 'Training Data'. After the predictor is calculated and ready, it is used to predict expected output, based on the given input. 

What do mean by by "parametric predictor model"? Equation 1 shows such a model:

### Equation 1: Parametric predictor model

$$\hat{y} = h(x) =b+\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i*x_i$$

Equation 1, presents a parametric model, where parameters are \\({b, w_i}\\), which predicts the value of \\(y\\), marked here \\(\hat{y]\\), according to the system's input \\({x_i}\\).


Throughout next posts we will delve into Equation 1 and show methods to find the model's parameters  \\({b, w_i}\\) .

The important detail here, not to say amazing, is that the same parametric equation concept, with similar solutions, solves so many problems in so many different topics.


Take a look at Figure 3, which is a sketch of a typical ML system (Supervised ML - we will review the various types later). 
The idea presented in that sketch, is of the 2 phase Machine Learning system operation:

1. Training phase
2. Noraml Data phase



### Figure 3: Machine Learning system's outlines

![Supervised learning outlines](../assets/images/supervised/outlines-of-machine-learning-system-model.svg)


During the Training phase, the system runs with 'labeled data' input, i.e. each entry of the input data is labeled with its expected output. For example, in the above cat classification example problem, the labeled data set would consist of pictures, each with either 'a cat' label or 'not a cat" label.

Goal of traning phase, is to determine the coefficients for the selected prediction model function:
\\(h(x)\\) - see Equatio 1. 

===reviewed till here=====

To do that, it normally needs a large training set, where each element of that dataset is a labeled input data. At this point, it may all sound vage: How does that "magic" prediction function look like? what coefficients are we tailking about? In a nutshell, the predictor out put is \\(\hat{y}\\), which estimates \\\\\\({y}$\\). To illustrate that with an example, then \\(\hat{y}\\) is the 'a cat' or 'not a cat' decision made bythe predictor, which tryies to predict \\({y}\\), which is the correct "cat", "no cat" decision.
We'll delve to the details in posts which follow. This is an introductory post.

Having the predictor, we can move to the normal data phase, at which the system is ready to predict the expected output for unlabeled input data:
$$\hat{y}=h(x))$$

And here's another 'technical detail': between the "Training" phase and the "Normal Data" phase, there's the "Testing" phase, at which the system performance is evaluated, and accordingly, it should be decided if it is acceptable or requires more training or any type of a modification.  See Figure 4.
We'll ofcourse review the various performance criteria, and how should that be done.

Figure 4: Machine Learning - The 3 phases

![supervised learning](../assets/images/supervised/supervised-learning.svg)



Now with the ML concept presented, still vagely though, before concluding the intro, we should crystalizee it a bit more:
The 3 phase model presented, relates to one type MAchine Learning algorithms, named "Supervised Learning". Supervised Learning is currently considered the mostly implemented ML algorithm type. 

The 3 types of ML algorithms currently considered are:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

Here's an introductory to each of the 3 types.

Supervised Learning - This is the type presented by Figures 1 and 2, also used as an example to ML with the 'cat' 'no cat' classification problem. As noted above, it is currently the most common and practically used ML type. Named 'Supervised', it requires a supervision intervention to prepare the training labeled data. Data labeling can be a tedious task in the better case, or an impossible mission when a large scale of data is needed for the training. BTW, how can we tell if a larger set of data is required? We'll cover that one later.
Anyway, the 2 common Supervised Learning types of problem are:
1. Classification
2. Regression

In Classification problems, according to input, the problem is to decide which of the output classes should be selected between a descret (=finite) set of classes, e.g. "cat" or "not a cat", which is a binary classification problem, or a multi classification problem e.g. 'cat', 'dog', 'wolf' or 'elephant'.
In Regression problems, according to input, the problem is to determine the output value, which now is not descrete but continous. e.g., based on various features, such as address, floor, area, and number of bedrooms, predict the price of a flat.

Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is mostly about finding hidden information inside the data. Point is,in contrust to Supervised Learning, the data is not labeled so the type of "hidden information" sought after, is not apriori known, but discovered from the data . Common Unsupervised Learning applications are:
Clustering - grouping the input in clusters according to common charectaristics found, e.g. color, shape, biochemical structure, probabily distribution, etc, as illustrated in Figure 4. Note that clusters presented in Figure 4 are of 2 dimensions, because it is preactically easier to present graphically, (can present 3 dimensions at the most), though in many cases clusters will have  more dimentsions. (Was asked about the meanings of probabily distribution, so here's an example: Task is signal-noise decomposition, where signal is a sinusoid and noise has white spectral probability density. Clustering will decompose the noise-signal).


Figure 4: Clusters (2D)

![clusters](../assets/images/unsupervised/clusters.png)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) - Unlike Supervised learning, which is based on labeled data, or unsupervsed learning, which finds hidden data patterens,RL suits interactive processes, and is modeled as a markovian process, aka Markov Decision Process (MDP). 
The RL model is skethed on Figure 5.

Figure 5: Reinforcement Learning Model
![reinforced](../assets/images/reinforced/reinforced.svg)

Fitted to interactive processes, Reinforcement Learning is a closed loop model at which the action influences its next input - as shown by Figure 5.
The model presents 2 attributes: Agent and Environment.
The Agent is the software entity which generates actions towards the Environment, based on a learning process, which inputs are the Reward and the State, provided by the Environment.
The Environmentis reflects the problem, whether it is a Chess game, where the status reflects the board and the Reward reflects the benefit of the moves.



the decisions and learns based on the input generated by Environment. The Environment send a feedback to the Agent, based on hist actions. Those are the Reward and the State.
, which is a feedback for the Agent on his last action, and a State reflects the benefit that the Agent should get as  as a feedback 

The reward attribute is a numerical value which is 

The action does not influence only the next reward, but also the next state, which again, in a closed loop form, influences on the next action.


The reward is a numerical value, a scalar, 
Given those, the question is: which actions should a software agent take. The agentâ€™s goal should be to get a maximal amount of rewards, without being told which action to take.  Unlike supervised learning which learns from a training set of labeled examples, each identify an hypothesis to which the situation belongs, in RL, the agent reacts to situations which don't belong to a training set, which is  impractical to obtain for all interactive situations which agent has to act. RL is also different from unsupervised learning which typically is about finding structure hidden in collections of unlabeled data. Though RL too does not rely on examples of correct behavior, RL tries to maximaize a reward rather than find hidden patterns or structures in the data)


( the best action to take given the current state. )



Here are examples:

(from book: A mobile robot decides whether it should enter a new room in search of trash to collect, or start his way back to its charging station. Decision is based on current charge level and of how quickly could it find the charger in the padt


 whenin some senses similar to supervised classification, but decisions are made sequentially.

much poorer to the - performance of such algorithms were much poorer than the results of current machine learning algorithms.

On the other hand, a machine learning algorithm model which fit this problem, would be executed in 2 phases:
Training phase - at this stage, the algorithm calculates a set of weight coefficients w, which maximize the likelihood of a stochastic predictor: \\(p_{w}(y|x)\\)


The prediction phase - at this stage the predicted decision \\(\hat{y}\\( is calculated using the predictor calculated during the training phase.

Figure 1 below illustrates the machine learning algorithm operations described above.
Note that in most actual cases, the machine learning algorithm will pass through 3 phases, where a â€˜testâ€™ phase is normally added between the training and the read data phases, as illustrated in Figure 2. During the test phase, the error between the predicted result \\(\hat{y}\\) and the expected by label y, will be used to decide if the predictor is valid or needs refinements.

More details on the prediction method, how it is calculated, how it works, the 3 phases, etc - in posts which will follow.

So far we tried we illustrated a machine learning algorithm with the cat image recognition task. That task belongs to one category of ML, named Supervised learning. 

Currently the 3 major machine learning categories are:
Supervised learning - currently the most commonly used category
Unsupervised learning
Reinforcement learning.

Letâ€™s briefly describe those 3 categories. We will delve into things in later dedicated posts.


Supervised learning - As can be seen in figures 1 and 2, supervised learning consists of a learning phase with labeled data, just as illustrated with the cat recognition case discussed above.  The reason for naming it â€˜supervisedâ€™ was the fact that it should be labeled (e.g. as a â€˜catâ€™ or â€˜not a catâ€™) by a knowledgeable supervisor. Data is labeled during phase data too.

The 2 common types of supervised categories are:
Classification
Regression



Classification is the problem of assigning the input data to one of the systemâ€™s classes, e.g. the binary classification: â€˜a catâ€™ or â€˜not a cat.
Hereâ€™s another example of a classification for a supervised machine learning: predict whether a person will buy the newest iphone. - See table 1 below. 


Table 1: Iphone purchase prediction - Binary classification, with structured data


$$x_{1}$$ 
Annual Income ($)
$$x_{2}$$ 
Zip code
$$x_{3}$$ 
House ownership
$$y$$
 Will he buy the newest iphone? 
21200
32321
yes
yes
135000
54322
no
no
243000
43243
yes
yes
320000
63422
yes
no




Each input in table 2 consists of 3 features. The training set consists of 4 labeled examples.



, the input x has 3 features: Annual Income, zip code, and house owning. According to those 3 features {$$x_{1} x_{2} x_{3}$$}, class $$y\hat{}$$ should be predicted, in this case itâ€™s a binary classification - Will the customer buy a new iphone or not. Note that the input data, the â€˜featuresâ€™ can be arranged in a table. This type of data is known as â€˜structuredâ€™ as opposed to unstructured data, e.g. image input of the previous example.


In Regression supervised learning, the predicted result is not a discrete class, but a continuous value. Table 2 demonstrate a supervised regression machine learning: Predict house prices based on 3 features

Table 3:  House price prediction - regression supervised learning



Number of bedrooms
$$x_{2}$$
Zip code
$$x_{3}$$
floor
$$y$$

21000
2$$x_{1}$$
43243

25000

63422

26000


Note - it is obvious that these 3 features are not enough to predict prices of houses. More features are needed, otherwise, we will see underfitting of results. Overfitting and underfitting will be discussed in future posts.

 Unsupervised Learning

Unlike Supervised Learning, unsupervised learning is used for clustering, and dimensionality reduction  of the data to groups with similar characteristics the machine determines, e.g. similar color of particles in molecular images, similar biochemical structure in viruses or similar probability distribution, which can be used to detect a signal consists noise.  Unlike conventional computer programs, which need to cluster according to apriori known features, now the underlying patterns are discovered by the algorithm.



Figure 3: Clustering









Unlike Supervised learning, as implicit by its name, no labeled training data is needed. This is significant where labeling a large data becomes a complicated task, not to say too complicated when a large scale of training set is required.


How many clusters should the algorithm create? There are some approaches:
Fix number or k clusters
Variable number - find best clustering according to a criteria function.


Letâ€™s see a clustering example, using k-means, one of the most common clustering algorithms, yet one of the simplest. Her k, the number of clusters is assumed apriori. The algorithm searches for the centers of each of the k clusters. Each point of the dataset should be associated to the nearest clusterâ€™s center aka centroid. 

The objective is to minimize the squared error distance function:
$$J=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left \|x_{i}-c_{j} \right \|$$

Where J is the cost function, which is the sum of distances between each set point to its related centroid.

So hereâ€™s the algorithm:

Randomly select k cluster centers, denoted as $$c_{j}$$. (a popular way to do it -randomly select k data points from the data sets)
Calculate distance between each data point and all cluster centers
Assign each data point to the cluster which distance to its center is minimal
Recalculate cluster centers with:
$$c_{i}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j-1}^{n}x_i$$
Recalculate distance between each data point and all cluster centers
Assign the each data point to the cluster which distance to its center is minimal
If no datapoint was reassigned to another cluster, stop. Otherwise, repeat from step 6

Unlike Supervised Learning, In Unsupervised Learning, aim of prediction is not to classify data to pre-determined hypothesis or forecast a value according to features, but to determine outcomes based of analysis of the data, e.g. clustering images according to shape, colors or any other clustering characteristic the machine determines.

  Reinforcement learning.


Reinforcement learning is used to make decisions sequentially, when input depends on the state of the previous output. Learning is based on 3 concepts: state, action and reward/punishment, as illustrated in the figure below




Finite markovian model



Reinforcement learning is a closed loop problem at which the action influences its next input.The action does not influence the next reward, but also the next state, which again, in a closed loop form, influences on the next action.

1. Parametric Model
Assumptions are the crucial part of any data model, it not only makes the model easy also improves predictions, so the algorithms that consider assumptions and make the function simple are known as parametric ML algorithms, and a learning model that compiles data with different parameters of a predetermined size, independent to number of training variables, is termed as parametric model.
2. Non-parametric Model
ML algorithms that enable to make strong assumptions in terms of the mapping function are called non-parametric Ml algorithms and without worth assumptions, ML algorithms are available to pick up any functional form training data. Non-parametric models are a good fit for the huge amount of data with no previous knowledge.
