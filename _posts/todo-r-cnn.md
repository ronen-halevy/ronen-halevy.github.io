Final Thoughts
R-CNN fundamentally changed the landscape of object detection at the time of its conception, and it has radically influenced the design of modern-day detection algorithms.

In spite of that, one of the major shortcomings of R-CNN was the speed with which it worked. For example, as the original paper noted, simply computing region proposals and features would take 13 seconds per image on a GPU. This is clearly too slow for a real-time object detection algorithm.

Follow-up work sought to reduce the runtime of the model, especially time spent on computing region proposals. We will discuss these improved algorithms including Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO in subsequent blog posts.

In the meantime, if you are interested in further checking out some of R-CNNâ€™s implementation details, you can see the original repo.
