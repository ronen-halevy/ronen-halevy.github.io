The Background for proposing this Neural Network model, was the challenge of implementing deeper CNNs to achieve better classification performance. Though deeper CNNs resulted with improved performance, for various tasks such as recognition, detction, segmentation etc.On the other hand, for much deeper networks, problems such as vanishing/exploding gradients became more significant. Resnet proposes a model which enables training very deep networks - the [resnet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) - it presents Resnet-34, Resnet-50, Resnet-101 and Resnet-152, which deploy 34, 50, 101 and 152 parametric layers respectively.
Resnet building block is called a `Residual Block` which contains a `skip` connection, aka a `short-cut` as described next.



even over 100 layers. To achieve that, it deploys `skip` connection,
